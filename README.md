# Visualizing COVID-19
The COVID-19 coronavirus was initially discovered in the Chinese province of Wuhan in December 2019. The World Health Organization (WHO) designated the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Between then and now, a lot has occurred, including significant outbreaks in Italy, South Korea, and Iran.
